# AI-Powered Code Intelligence & Review Platform

A hybrid static analysis and AI-enhanced code intelligence platform designed to evaluate software quality, security risk, and maintainability using unified issue normalization, advanced metrics, and density-based scoring.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This platform analyzes source code using static analysis tools, normalizes issues into a unified schema, computes advanced engineering metrics, and produces a density-based risk score.

It is designed to go beyond basic linting by:

- Unifying multiple tools into a single issue model
- Calculating weighted risk using severity density
- Tracking historical trends
- Highlighting top refactor priorities
- Providing structured metrics for engineering decisions

## 🏗 Architecture

## 🧠 Key Features

### ✅ Unified Issue Model
All tools are normalized into:


UnifiedIssue {
tool,
rule_id,
severity (low | medium | high),
confidence,
file,
line,
message,
category
}


---

### 📊 Advanced Metrics

- Total issues
- Severity breakdown
- Issues by tool
- Lines of Code (LOC)
- Top refactor priority files
- Heatmap (file-wise severity counts)
- Most recurring issues
- Historical trend tracking

---

### 🎯 Density-Based Scoring Engine

Score calculation considers:

- Severity weights
- Issue density per KLOC
- Logarithmic penalty scaling
- Final score clamped to 0–100


final_score = clamp(100 - penalty, 0, 100)


Risk Levels:

- 80–100 → Low Risk
- 50–79  → Medium Risk
- 0–49   → High Risk

---

### 📈 Trend Tracking

Each scan appends:


storage/history/<project_key>/trend.jsonl


Tracked fields:

- Timestamp
- Total issues
- Severity counts
- Score
- LOC

This allows future predictive analytics and risk forecasting.
